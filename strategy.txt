Algorithm - Version 1.0 to current:

	from scratch at the start of the side's turn

	for each possible move (put and twist combination) for this side (empty dimples * 8 rotations)
		computes a frequency plot w[] of the 32 possible wins
				(12 horizontal, 12 vertical, 4 diagonal, and 4 <triple power play>)
			against the minimum number of additional moves (ignoring opponent moves)
			to achieve that win. Blocked wins are considered to be 6 moves away.
			
			for a completely empty board, w = [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 32, 0 ]
				(all wins are a minimum of 5 moves away)
			for a single marble placed in a quadrant center, w = [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 26, 0 ]
				(6 wins are now only 4 moves away: 2 horizontal, 2 vertical, and 2 diagonal)
				
		computes a similar plot l[] of the opponent's wins.
		
			if the board is empty except for one opponent's marble in a quadrant center
				and this player places a marble in a corner of the same quadrant
					l = [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 26, 0 ]	(same as before - in this case)
					w = [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 21, 2 ]
						(9 wins are 4 moves away: 4 horizontal, 4 vertical, and 1 <triple power play>
							2 diagonal wins are blocked)
	
		this move's l and w are compared to the current best's l and w
			if this move is not as good as the current best, it is discarded
			if this move is better, it becomes the current best
			if equally good, it might replace the current best, depending on a weighted algorithm



Controls

	Basic:
		Options
			Calls OptionsDialog
		Undo
			Undoes the last move (put or twist).
			If the computer is playing one side, undoes moves until one by the player has been undone.
			If the computer is playing both sides, undoes moves until a put has been undone.

	Full:
		Options
			Calls OptionsDialog
		Status bar
			Displays a bar graph of black and white moves and a playhead position indicator.
			Clicking on a move
				Pauses the game
				Moves the playhead to after that move and shows the game state at that point
				Reveals the Back, Forward, Record, and Play buttons
		Back button
			Moves the playhead back one move (with animation)
		Forward button
			Moves the playhead forward one move (with animation)
		Record button
			Discards all moves following the playhead
			Unpauses the game
		Play button
			Unpauses the game (Game advances playhead, animating moves)
	
	
	Notes
		If you exit the options dialog (via OK) with full controls unselected,the game will be unpaused.
		If this happens with the playhead not at the end, you will be locked out
		until all the following moves have been animated.

	randomly neglect to check rotations on wins
		( by level of threat - opponent's windistance before move?)
