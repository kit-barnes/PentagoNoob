# PentagoNoob
My Pentago-playing apps.

### Game

The game [Pentago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago) was invented by Tomas Flod&eacute;n.
Two players alternate placing marbles on a 6 by 6 grid - trying to get 5 in a row.
It becomes complex because the grid is divided into four 3 by 3 quadrants,
one of which the player must rotate after placing a marble.

All 3 versions below enforce the rules, animate the play, and offer computer players
of varying strengths for either or both sides.  Source and binaries are provided.

### Flash App (2008-2009)

Built with Macromedia Flash 8, there are many reasons this version should never be updated.
The binary SWF file can still be executed using Internet Explorer.

### Java Applet (2009-2010)

Built using the Eclipse IDE, I expect this version would be
the easiest of the three to modify and build again.

### Android App (2010-2012)

Built with the Android Development Tools plugin for the Eclipse IDE
and targeting the Froyo version of Android,
this tiny app still runs nicely on the latest versions.
Other than possibly aesthetics, I see no reason to update it.
